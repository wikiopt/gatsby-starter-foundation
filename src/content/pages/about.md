Skating was no longer a regular sport. People had started seeing it as a hobby, a way of life. Some people could hardly go a day without skating. Such was its attachment to people’s lifestyles. Within blocks on campuses, on the street, at the parks, and almost everywhere, you would see people skating.

Unfortunately, the joy of skating was often marred by low-quality skateboards until 2008, when professional skaters Jim Greco and Erik Ellington founded Deathwish Skateboard. The company was founded as a way to keep people’s love for skating intact.

Since its inception, the company has always pushed for the production of high-quality skateboards in the right course, not slacking on quality and giving skaters the best boards their feet rock and their pockets can afford. Today, Deathwish is a household name when it comes to the production of skateboards that gives everlasting joy. Powered by a team of incredible minds and world-class skaters like Brian Hansen, Romero Salcedo, Neen Williams, Luis De Los Reyes, and the founders themselves, Deathwish skateboards are a haven of functionality and versatility.

## Why Deathwish Skateboards?

Choice differs truly, but if you are willing to have a long-lasting relationship with your board, then Deathwish Skateboard is your plug. There are several reasons you should consider buying the deathwish skateboard, and some of those are listed below.

* #### Logo

Inspired by a picture from the movie “Death Wish,” the deck bears a picture of Charles Bronson and his gun. Jim claimed the image had a historical background, and it had given deathwish the strength to spin-off from a sister company -Bakers. The logo symbolizes historical strength.

* #### Reliability

Another reason to consider any Deathwish skateboard is its reliability. The company has been consistent and steadfast over the years, and this justifies its reliability. Despite numerous challenges, there has never been a dwindling effect on Deathwish’s quality of boards. As a Deathwish skateboard user, you have nothing to worry about when it comes to efficiency. They will surely deliver.

There is no fear of any part wearing off fast, tights slacking fast, or of bolts losing quickly. If wisely used and maintained, the skateboard is sure to stand the test of time.
