This is one of the best cameras for skateboarding photography when you want to capture still images from a spot. With Sony’s portable FDR-AX100, you can capture breathtaking still images from the palm of your hand with ease. Every photo is captured with cinematic depth because of the powerful 1-inch image sensor.

With a good supply of light, while you skateboard, this camera can capture amazing shots from different angles. You can easily navigate and move around because the camera is not bulky and will help you remain flexible as you film. Note that this camera might not perform optimally under low light conditions.

Ensure that your lighting is always good to get the clearest images with the most color. This camera is also better for still images and not pictures while in motion. You will get the best quality when you place it on a tripod and capture skateboarding action from one spot. To add variety to your filming, try to change the angles of shooting as you perform.

The still images from the FDR-AX100 will rival most of Sony’s other products. This camera has been carefully crafted to provide extreme shots in the clearest format possible.

Whether you’re indoors or outdoors, you will get the best still images for your skateboarding photography. To get this kind of quality on a high-end camera, you could pay $5000 or more. But Sony has provided this great tool on a budget so skateboarders can enjoy all the perks on a budget.
