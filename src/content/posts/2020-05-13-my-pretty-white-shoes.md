This camera works perfectly in dim light conditions, and the microphone is good enough to capture many sounds. Apart from the amazing 20x zoom feature, you will also enjoy great slow-motion action filming and photography with this device.

You can connect and use your smartphone as a second camera with the wi-fi feature on this device. This will allow you to shoot scenes from different angles and distances for an overall great film. Even when you have to shoot in poorly lit conditions, the BMI sensors on this camera will suppress noise to deliver the best and most crispy images for you.

This camcorder also comes fitted with some special effects you can use to make your skateboard shooting more dramatic. Because of all the movement happening as you skate, the last thing you want is many shaky images that don’t look good.

This camcorder has a level shot feature that automatically adjusts tilted images to get leveled looking shots. You can turn this feature off if you’re going for off-center images.

This amazing camcorder will give you a lot of flexibility to shoot as you please while delivering picture-perfect shots. The easily adjustable functions are easy to use and change with the turn of a simple knob.

This will let you adjust shutter speed, sharpness, brightness, and many other functions very easily. If you want to show off your friends’ skills in live-action, simply create a live broadcast and stream full HD images over wi-fi.
