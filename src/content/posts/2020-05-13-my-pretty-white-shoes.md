This Camera works perfectly in dim light conditions, and the microphone is good enough to capture many sounds. Apart from the amazing 20x zoom feature, you will also enjoy great slow-motion action filming and photography with this device.

You can connect and use your smartphone as a second camera with the wi-fi feature on this device. This will allow you to shoot scenes from different angles and distances for an overall great film. Even when you have to shoot in poorly lit conditions, the BMI sensors on this camera will suppress noise to deliver the best and most crispy images for you.
